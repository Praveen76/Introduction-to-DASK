# Introduction to DASK

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that provides an introduction to using Dask for parallel computing in Python. The notebook demonstrates how to implement and utilize various Dask libraries for data processing and machine learning tasks.

## Repository Contents

- `Introduction_to_Dask.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook that covers the basics of Dask, including setup, usage, and examples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this experiment, you will be able to:

- Know and implement Dask related libraries
- Understand and visualize parallel processing using Dask delayed
- Implement Dask arrays
- Handle large and complex datasets in Dask DataFrames
- Implement lists using Dask bags
- Implement linear regression using Dask-ML

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Necessary Python packages (listed in the `requirements.txt` file)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Praveen76/Introduction-to-DASK.git
    cd Introduction-to-DASK
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

    ```sh
    jupyter notebook
    ```

    or

    ```sh
    jupyter lab
    ```

2. Open the notebook `Introduction_to_Dask.ipynb`.

3. Follow the instructions and run the cells in the notebook to learn about and use Dask for parallel computing and data processing.
